# hello-world

Hi,
I'm a long-time Verilog and VHDL coder.  I've been a ClearCase user for almost as long.  I've heard another engineer or two mention Git, but I didn't know much about what they were talking about.  I've been taking a Python class recently and it pointed me here.  So, here I am, writing my readme file.

August 8, 2022 update: I'm taking a Git class on Udemy, and I'm reusing this repository to work through the lesson examples.
